# WEB VULNERABILITY DETECTION: THE CASE OF CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY

> **Abstract** : Web-based technology has become increasingly popular, but it has also led to a rise in web-based attacks on sensitive data. Inadequate input validation is a major cause of vulnerabilities that developers often overlook, leading to more open web apps. Implementing web service security is crucial to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks and protect user data. In this project, we propose a methodology to leverage Machine Learning (ML) for the detection of web application vulnerabilities. Web applications are particularly challenging to analyses, due to their diversity and the widespread adoption of custom programming practices. ML is thus very helpful for web application security: it can take advantage of manually labelled data to bring the human understanding of the web application semantics into automated analysis tools. We use our methodology in the design of Mitch, the first ML solution for the black-box detection of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. Mitch allowed us to identify 35 new CSRFs on 20 major websites and 3 new CSRFs on production software.
